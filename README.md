# HydroPol2D

With the purpose of enhancing the analysis of 2D modeling of floods and pollutant transport and fate, HydroPol2D was developed.

HydroPol2D is a tool developed in Matlab and Python that allows:

- Flood inundation modeling
- Determining hydrographs and stage-hydrographs in any given point of the catchment
- Modeling spatial-variant rainfall and evapotranspiration
- Modeling spatial infiltration
- Modeling inflow hydrograph boundary conditions
- Simulating pollutant transport and fate,
- among others

The software requires a license of Microsoft Excel 2013 or superior and Matlab 2021 or higher. 

Please, refer to the Supplementary Material for detailed information on the interfaces and equations used in the software.
